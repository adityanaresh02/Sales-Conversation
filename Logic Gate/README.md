# Neural Network Implementation of Logic Gates

Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital electronics and computer systems. They perform logical operations on binary inputs to produce a binary output. In this project, we explore the implementation of logic gates using artificial neural networks (ANNs). We demonstrate how a simple neural network can learn to approximate the behavior of three basic logic gates: AND, OR, and XOR.

# Training the Neural Network
The neural network is trained using a supervised learning approach, where the network is presented with a set of input-output pairs and adjusts its weights and biases to minimize the error between the predicted and actual outputs. The training process involves the following steps:

Forward Propagation: The input values are propagated through the network to produce an output.
Error Calculation: The error between the predicted and actual outputs is calculated using a loss function (mean squared error).
Backpropagation: The error is propagated backwards through the network to update the weights and biases.
Weight Update: The weights and biases are updated using an optimization algorithm (stochastic gradient descent).

# Logic Gate Implementation
The neural network is trained to implement three basic logic gates: AND, OR, and XOR. The input-output pairs for each gate are as follows:

AND Gate: (0, 0) → 0, (0, 1) → 0, (1, 0) → 0, (1, 1) → 1

OR Gate: (0, 0) → 0, (0, 1) → 1, (1, 0) → 1, (1, 1) → 1

XOR Gate: (0, 0) → 0, (0, 1) → 1, (1, 0) → 1, (1, 1) → 0

The trained neural network is able to approximate the behavior of each logic gate with high accuracy. The decision boundary of the network is visualized using a contour plot, which shows the separation of the input space into two regions corresponding to the two possible outputs of the logic gate.
